Docker commands are essential for managing Docker containers and images. With `docker run`, you can start a new container, whereas `docker ps` lists all running containers. To stop a container, use `docker stop`, followed by the container ID or name. For managing images, `docker images` displays all available images on your system, and `docker pull` downloads an image from Docker Hub. Understanding and utilizing these commands effectively can greatly enhance your Docker experience, allowing for efficient container management and deployment.
